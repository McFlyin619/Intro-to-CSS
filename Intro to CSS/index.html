                <h2>It's a cheap modification with big results</h2>
                <p>
                    Chassis braces provide the best "bang for your buck" when attempting to extract everything out of your ride! These parts shore up deficits in the stock platform and don't impact the drive-ability of the car. Not only do they make the car a more stable platform to work on, but the price is in competition with an intake.

                <h2>What happens when you add chassis bracing</h2>
                <p>
                    Installing a full set of braces will not only improve handling, and drag times, but also make it easier to learn how to drive your car to the best of its ability. If the chassis becomes more predictable you will have an easier time taking your car to its limits because you will have a more tangible limit.

                <h2>How it's overlooked in the industry</h2>
                <p>
                    Chassis Braces are the most overlooked part of building a performance car. People will buy an intake then exhaust then coilovers when they begin the process of modifying their car. Chassis Braces are viewed as the last piece of the puzzle or a "bonus part." This logic has some flaws in it.
